## Task 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation (Python)

This project is part of the **CodeTech Python Programming Internship**. The objective of Task 4 is to build a simple predictive model using Python and the scikit-learn library.

In this task, a basic text classification model is implemented to classify messages as either spam or not spam. A small sample dataset is used to train the model. The text data is converted into numerical format using the `CountVectorizer` technique, and a Naive Bayes classifier is trained to learn patterns from the dataset.

After training, the model is tested with a new sample message. Based on learned patterns, the model predicts whether the message is spam or not spam and displays the result in the terminal.

This project demonstrates the fundamental workflow of machine learning: data preparation, feature extraction, model training, and prediction.
